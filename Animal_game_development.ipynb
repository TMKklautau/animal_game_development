    "So in the end accessing a child directly is impossible the only way is searching the List present in AnimalDAO passing it, the index of the father node, and the path (0/1) that takes to that child, if the node is a leaf then you must need to search every single element to finaly get that information.\\\n",
    "When the active node is a leaf on the path chosen by the player a prompt with the animal saved on the respostaSim or respostaNao (1/0 paths) is presented to the player as his animal, if the player confirms the game ends, if he denies he then has a chance to add his chosen animal and a question that is used to define it, growing the tree.\\\n",
